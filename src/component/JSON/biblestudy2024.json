      "INTRODUCTION": "In Christian tradition, the eighth day after Christ's birth is mostly observed on January 1 as\nthe feast of circumcision. According to Luke 2:21, the circumcision of Jesus was an event\nfor the naming of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is in keeping with the Jewish law which holds\nthat males should be circumcised eight days after birth (Gen 17:12) during a Brit-Milah\n(Brit means covenant and Milah means cutting of the foreskin) ceremony, at which they\nare also given their name. (Gen 21:3-4). Even though our Lord Jesus was not born in sin,\nand did not need that mortification of a corrupt nature, or that renewal unto holiness, which\nwere signified by circumcision; however, this ordinance reveals his future perfect\nobedience to the whole law, in the midst of sufferings and temptations, even unto death for\nus. In our text today (Col 2:4-12), Paul admonished Christians to circumcise their hearts so\nas to purify it from old teachings concerning outward cleansing and profane philosophies\nthat can corrupt their hearts against sanctification",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Epiphany comes from the Greek epiphaneia, meaning \"appearance\" or \"manifestation,\"\nand refers to the manifestation of Jesus Christ to the world. The feast of Epiphany\n(originally observed on January 6 in the Roman Rite), is one of the oldest liturgicai\ncelebrations, even before Christmas was established on December 25. We celebrated this\nyesterday and today, being the first Sunday after, we shall be studying the topic: Shine the-\nlight. In today's Bible passage, Paul enlightened the Ephessian Christians on how God\nmysteriously revealed Himself to himn, which advertently gave him the boldness and\npower to reveal the same mystery to the Ephesians through the message of salvation. Like\nPaul, how can we, as Christians shine the light of the gospel we have received to the world\naround us as we run our Christian race?\n",

He emphasised on the disciplined habits in all aspects of life (1 Cor.9:25 27.  Like earthly participants, Christians on the heavenly race are also admonished to live discipline lives in order to win the imperishable crown of life.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Rivalry simply means competition for the same objective or for superiority in the same field. Earthly race is based on rivalry, whereby the competitors try as much as possible to outshine one another. It is with the notion of being the best. In that case, there is always envy on the part of the loser against the winner. . Sometimes, the\nreferee is accused of preferential treatment, while at other times the loser may immediately challenge the winner like in Boxing or wrestling. In our text today, we can see the rival race between a husband and his wife for blessings on their favourite child. It ended in bitter rivalry between Esau and Jacob.\n\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "In earthly race, the invitation for medal presentation to winners is the height of\nsuch events. Yet, they, are all forgotten within short time especially after the\ndemise of the winner; thereby making the short-term glorification a vanity.\nVainglory is the sin or vice of someone that immoderately desires renown,\nprestige, or the praise and respect of others. The desire of these things is not\nnecessarily sinful, but becomes so when it is immoderate and disordered. Haman\nwas a man that always seeks self-glorification. This bad focus led him into evil\ncompetition with Mordecai.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "In the context of our Bible passage today, explain 'vain glory. See Est 3:2, 5.\n2. What was the end of Haman's glory? Est 7:10.\nCan you mention a renowned sportsman or sportswoman in the 1970s.\n1980s, or 1990s? How were their memories? Are they still celebrated? If\nthey are still celebrated, how?

How can the Church be more focused on Christ's kingdom matters than on vain glory? Col 3:1-2; 1John 2:15-17.\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "If all kinds of efforts and strictest discipline are invested to obtain medals for earthly races, but yet, they are perishable, corruptible and with vain satisfaction; Christians must run their race to eternal life with all diligence for the imperishable, incorruptible, and eternal glory.",

      "AIMS": "to compare rewards of earthly races and that of the heavenly or eternal one and\ni. to help us re-capture and concentrate on pursuits that has eternal value.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION": "While earthly rewards are good and laudable, they are temporary. In our Bible passage today, we can see the reward for the good works of Joseph in Potiphar's in Gen 39:1-6. His master made him the commander in Chief of his household. However, things changed for Joseph when he failed to compromise his godly\nposition in Verse 7-18. An excellent reward therefore turned to life imprisonment in Verses 19-20. Our study guides shall open us more into how to run our race in order to win eternal reward.\n",
      "STUDY GUIDES": "How can you describe temporary rewards in line with our study today?\nCompare with 1Sam18:1-2,6,8-11.\n2. How can a Christian participate or be engaged in earthly race without\ncompromising his/her focus on things that have eternal value? Col.2:8; 3:5;\n2Tim 2:5, 22-23.\n3. How would you compare the rewards of earthly races and that of the heavenly\none? 1Cor 9:25; 2Cor 4:18.\n4. The Church today appears to be succumbing to earthly attractions and its\nreward system and are losing sight of the heavenly one. Discuss in line with\nCol3:1-2;2Tim 2:19-21.\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "Surely. the goal of earthly races is laudable rewards. However the serious-minded Christian must know and be able to set boundary of convictions to safeguard his or her soul in those pursuits. A steady gaze on the goal\nof the heavenly race cannot be compromised if this must happen.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Our Bible passage today teaches us that though we are in the flesh, we do not war in the flesh; meaning., we war in the spirit. The greatest mistake any Christian can make is to run his her Christian race carnally. Our Lord Jesus Christ said, \"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must do so in spirit and in truth\" (John 4:24). This sets the tone for what the Christian race is: a spiritual one. (1 Cor 2: 14). Our study guides will expose us to more facts about the spiritual nature of our Christian race.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. Explain what we mean when we say the Christian race is spiritual and not 1 Cor 2:13-14. 2. Why is the Christian race a spiritual one? John 4:24; 1 Cor 2: 14; Eph.6: 1 0-18. 3. Identify the dangers of a carnal mind-set to the Christian from these texts: Rom.8:5-8;1 Cor.3:3.4. How can we effectively run the Christian race here on earth in a spiritual way? Eph.6:10-12 compare with the incidence in Est 4:15-16;5:2-3.\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "The Christian race is spiritual, and should never be run carnally to void irreconcilable challenges and consequences. To do this, we need to deploy all the means of grace at our disposal, both at individual and corporate\nlevels in the Church.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Lent is a period of 40 days during which Christians replicate the forty days fasting of Jesus Christ, whose life and teachings are the foundation of Christianity. It is a season that leads to the passion and death of Jesus Christ, for the redemption of the world. Our Bible passage today reveals to us that any fast that will attract God's favour and impartation must be focused on prayer and intercession, fasting (abstaining from something to reduce distractions and focus more on God) and works of charity. Therefore, as Christians, we must be focused on these so that the season will not become an ordinary religious routine.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1 How can you explain Lent to an unbeliever? Ex 34:28: Matt 4:2. 2.What should be the focuses of a Christian fast? Ps 35: 13; Ezr 10:6; Isa 58:6-7. 3. What are the reasons for a wasted fast or casual routinized Lenten season? Isa 58:3-5; Zech 7:5-6;Acts 23:13-15.4. What are the spiritual benefits of fasting in the Christian race? Exo 34:27-30; Matt 17:20-21; Ac l3:2-3.\n\n\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "If we must run a successful Christian race, the Lenten season is a period to re-equip ourselves spiritually. However, we must be careful to focusmore on Biblical injunctions so that the season does not turn to casual routine.",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Unlike the earthly reward that is temporal, the eternal reward will be foreverenjoyed in heaven. Rev 14:1-5 reveals those who finished their race on earth in holiness, truth and faith in Christ Jesus. They never allowed the glamour, the challenges and the sweetness of this world to defile them and take them out of the\ntrack of eternal life. Focusing on what will qualify us to win this eternal crown is very essential in our Christian race. Our study will beam more light to what it takes to win this reward.\n",

      "CONCLUSION": "Even though, as Christians, we may face various challenges persecutions on our race to the kingdom of God, our perseverance and steadfastness in the faith shall definitely end in glorious reward in eternity with God.

      "INTRODUCTION": "We thank God for another Easter morning, a day to celebrate the victory of our Lord Jesus Christ over death. In our Bible passage today, Paul exposed the fact that Christ\ndied as an innocent person for the sins He never committed, just for our righteousness and salvation (2Cor 5:15, 21). He admonished us that the best way to\nacknowledge this maximum sacrifice of Christ is to continuously live like Him and in Him (2Cor 5:1 5-17.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "As seen in our earlier studies, the broad-way Christianity is the kind whereeverything goes; everything is accommodated- that is: holy and sinful, legitimate\nand illegitimate, right and wrong. It is characterized by compromise. Compromisesimply means \"living by standards that are lower than the desirable,\" or double\nstandard.\" 1n our Bible Passage today, we see King Solomon, giving up the worshipof the Most High God to the worship of foreign idols because of the love for strange women. Let us go into our discussions to understand more of this topic.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Every sinful and ungodly way ends in destruction. People who tread on that way maybe enjoying it temporarily; but such 'enjoyment\" does not last. In our Bible reading\ntoday, Absalom plotted against his own father, the anointed king of Israel. Initially,the road seemed good and smooth, but it ended in his destruction.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Our study text today opens our eyes to the attitude of a truthful person. Zacchaeus did not hide his past sinful life; instead, he confessed them and resolved to change to\nthe path of truth. Not only did Zacchaeus see the error of his ways, but also he had a total change of heart. He no longer wanted to live a dishonest life, because hc came\nto know and believe in Jesus. In the narrow path, the believer does not live the way he wants. It is the way of truth. Our study guides will reveal to us how we can stay on\nthis path in our Christian race to God's kingdom.\n\n",

      "CONCLUSION": "Only the truth in Christ can set us free from the bondage of Satan and sin. When Zacchaeus truthfully confessed his sinful past, he was set free. Therefore, standing on and for the truth for a Christian should not be an option, but the norm.",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Salvation is free, but not cheap. Therefore, one can say that the Christian race is not as\neasy as it seems. The songwriter that wrote, It's not an easy road, we're travelling to\nheaven, and many are the thorns on the way...\" is right. Today, we read of Paul's\nafflictions from wicked and hostile persecutors on his evangelical journeys, yet he\nnever derailed. Our study guides shall open our eyes more to how uneasy it is and how\nwe can successfully navigate our way through difficulties of being believers, and how\nto reap the benefits of walking on the narrow and uneasy way.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. From Paul's experience in our Bible Passage today, how can you describe the\nuneasy way to salvation? Compare with Matt 24:9-11.\n2. In view of the uneasy nature of the road, how can we successfully navigate the\npathway to eternal life as Christians? ITim. 6:12-14; Phil.4:8-9.\n3. In line with Luke 18:22-26, discuss why it is difficult for Christians to tread on the\nnarrow way to salvation. Compare with Acts 5:1 -4\n4.

      "CONCLUSION": "If all were easy, if all were bright, where would the fight be? By divine prerogative and design, the way to eternal life is not easy, and only the wise and\nthose who have truly made up their minds for Christ and His kingdom canpainstakingly stay the full course and berth safely.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Pentecost Sunday (also called Whit Sunday) is a Christian festival, which takes place on\nthe 50th day from or seventh Sunday after Easter Sunday. It commemorates the descent\nof the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were\nin Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks. Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to\nHis disciples after his return to His father in heaven; who will empower them to preach\nand teach them in all things.

      "INTRODUCTION": "We thank God for another Trinity Sunday; a Sunday that reminds us of the unity of God\nthe father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit as one God in three and not three gods in\none, The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ brings believers together in the unity of faith\nwith God the father, our maker; Jesus Christ our Saviour, (God the son) and the Holy\nSpirit, the Sanctifier of the Church.

According to our Bible passage today, persevere\nin faith, especially when we faced with difficulties is about trusting God to fulfil\nhis promises and that He understands our situation and sees our distress.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Passion has to do with strong enthusiastic feelings, desires or devotion to causes,\nwhich finally develop into an action. Godly passion is a zeal that stirs a reasonable\nperformance for soul winning into the kingdom of God. It is the passion of\nknowing and winning Christ according to our study text that propelled Paul to\nforsake all his worldly affluence and counted them as dung.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Vision can be defined as the ability or act of conceiving, visualizing, seeing, and\nunderstanding clearly what lies before or ahead. In our Bible passage today, Job\ncried for help in his afflictions, but was ignored. Brethren, servants, friends and\nbeneficiaries deserted him with intimidating and frustrating comments. Yet, Job\nhad a clear vision ofhis glorious end with the Lord after his earthly suffering. (Job\n19:25-27).\n",

      "CONCLUSION": "Running a race without knowing what lies ahead, is like\nembarking on a fruitless venture, Therefore, the power of a clear vision is needed to\nsee the end of our Christian journey in the face of challenges in the race to the\nkingdom of God.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Strength is the quality or state of being strong. This could be variously interpreted.\nOne of such is the power to resist attack. As Christians, we need the strength of\nGod to run through the difficult terrains on the path to the glorious eternity.

In our Bible passage today, we can see the Pharisee seeing himself\nas more righteous than the tax collector. He lost the blessings of God and his time\nin God's presence became a waste.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Passion for seeking human acceptance is the state whereby people choose to\nplease people for one reason or the other at the detriment of godliness. In our text,\nwe discovered how some Galatian believers defected from the original gospel\npreached by Apostle Paul because they were threatened by the zealous Jewish\nChristians that were teaching that the Old Testament practices such as\ncircumcision and dietary restrictions, were required for salvation; and thereby fall\ninto doctrinal errors so as to please fellow brethren.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. From the Bible passage today, explain what you understand by passion for\nhuman satisfaction and compare with John 12:42-43 and Gal 2:11-12.\n2.

      "AIMS": "i. to discuss Noah's rugged faith in building the Ark and\nii. to re-iterate the doom for ungodliness like the days of Noah.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION": "Noah lived at the time the Lord's anger was upon the whole earth (Gen. 5: 28-30O).\nHowever, Noah received favour from the Lord because of his righteousness. He\nwas consequently instructed to build an ark for the preservation of humans and\nselected animals for future generation (Gen. 7: 1). Noah built the ark even when it\nappeared nonsensical to the people of his generation. We have a big lesson to learn\nfrom the righteous lifestyle of Noah and his usefulness in preserving lives.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. What is your understanding ofNoah's world, and why God spared him, his\nfamily and selected animals, despite the moral and spiritual decadence of\nthat time? Gen. 6: 5-10; Heb. 11:7;2 Pet. 2:5\n2. How can we compare the ministry of Noah with the great commission by\nour Lord Jesus Christ? Compare Matt 24:37-39 with Mk 16:15-16 also\ncompare the Ark with the Christian Church.\n3. What can we learn fromn the patience of Noah inside the Ark? Gen. 8: 1-3.\n4-10: Lam 3:26;\n4. Mention some of the ungodly habits in our generation than can arouse the\nanger of the Lord on this generation. If Christ should come today, will your\nfamily be saved like Noah and his family?\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "While the ark is a type of Christ's gospel for salvation, (Prov. 18:\n10), Noah's patience and obedience to God in the ark led to God's further\ncommanding him to be fruitful like Adam and Eve for a new human race. As\nChristians, let us continue to proclaim the gospel in manners that will win more\nsouls into God's kingdom.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "For someone to be called out of his kindred, to go to an unknown place calls for\nserious contemplation. Abraham was initially living in tents, but his deep faith\nmade him continuously look forward to see the city that has foundation that is\ndeeply rooted in the Almighty God. We have a lot to learn from this rugged faith.\nOur study guides will reveal more of this to us.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "l. How can you describe the answer of Abraham to the call of God according\nto Heb. 11:8. Relate this to the Christians' calling in Matt 28: 18-20.\n2. How will you describe Abraham's desire for a city with a foundation in the\ncontext of Heb. 11:10 and Rev 21:3? Relate it with the desire of Christians\ntoday. What are the desires of Christians and what should be their desires?\n3. How will you take the challenge to go for soul-winning outreach in an unknown place?\n4With due respect to the priests' family; how do we react to transfer from\none station to another, especially when the new is not that buoyant?\nDiscuss in the context of Acts 15:37-38.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Sarah, the wife of Abraham was a faithful and obedient woman. She believed\nGod's promise, even though she was tempted to lose faith in her ability to be a\nmother. She believed in the promise, endured with her husband and ended with\nlaughter. Sarah was always dutiful to the extent that she catered for the unknown\nvisitors without prior notice.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Isaac was the promised child of God to Abraham and Sarah. However, the inquiry\nof Isaac in Gen 22:7 suggests that Abraham his father had influenced him in deep\nfaith. This clearly manifests in Isaac's blessing his sons, which could be seen as\nprophecies and foretelling of what they shall become in the future.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. Critically study Gen 22:7 and analyse the faith of Isaac in your own\nunderstanding.\n2. From Gen 27:27-29 and 39-40 analyse the blessings of Isaac to his sons.\nAre the blessings prophetic or just ordinary prayers? What can we learn\nfrom this for our old age?\n3. How did Isaac and Rebecca resolve the impending dangerous conflict\nbetween their sons because of Isaac's blessings? Gen 27:41-45; 28:5. What\nlessons can we derive from this?\n4.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Jacob was a controversial biblical hero of faith. However, we shall study the aspect of\nhis godly faith in the Almighty God. After his exit from home, Jacob had an encounter\nwith the Almighty God of Abraham and Isaac (Gen 28:13). Heeding the command of\nthis God (Gen 31:3,13), he resigned his employment with Laban to return home and\nserve the God of his fathers. (Gen 30:29-30). His manner of resolving the conflict\nbetween him and his brother Esau, his persistence in receiving the best from people and\nGod, and blessing his children in his old age are good examples for us in our Christian\nrace.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. From our Bible passage today, enumerate the faith of Jacob as attested to in Gen\n32:9-12. What can we learn from these, especially in verses 10-11?\n2. Analyse the method of Jacob in resolving the conflict between him and Esau his\nbrother Gen 32:13-20. What was the result in Gen 33:1-4? What are the lessons\nfor us in our Christian race? Matt 5:23-26.\n3.Discuss the absoluteness of Jacob's faith in Gen 35:1-4. How can we apply that in\nour home? Eph. 6:4.\n4. Differentiate between the prayerful blessings of Jacob to his children in Gen\n48:13-16 and his prophetic utterances to them in Gen 49:2-10. What lessons can\nwe draw from this as children of God?\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "As Jacob lived by the faith of his fathers. In like manner, our parents\nand godparents handed over faith to us. We must make sure we absolutely hand the\nsame over to our children and coming generation\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Joseph's life continues to be a shining example to Christians in all generations.\nBeginning from his sincerity in giving information about his brothers'\nmisdemeanour to his father, his chastity in Potiphar's house, his diligence in the\nprison, his prudency in ruling Egypt, his forgiving attributes and his prophetic\nutterances in his old age, Joseph remains a pillar of faith to emulate.

      "INTRODUCTION": "Moses was born at a time male infants were killed in Egypt in order to control the\nIsraelites' population. However, the faith of Moses' mother in the preserving power of\nGod, led her to hide him amidst the reeds of river Nile and eventually Moses was\ndelivered from death. By faith, Moses preferred to align with his brethren instead of\nthe oppressing Egyptians, even though, his faith led him into criminality, but in exile,\nhe enjoyed God's providence to lead Israel out of the land of slavery.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION": "Rahab, an idolater and prostitute testified to the marvellous works of the God of\nIsrael. Her faith in this God led her to protect the spies sent to Jericho.

Prophet Isaiah\nforetold of the coming of the Messiah in Isaiah 7: 14 and this prophesy was fulfilled in\nMatt 1:23 and throughout the earthly mission of our Lord Jesus Christ in His first\ncoming to redeem the world. Before his departure from earth, Jesus taught and always\nwarned of the undisclosed time of His second coming.

They were segregating among themselves\n(Eph 4:1ff;, 6:24) to the extent of neglecting the believers' communal love. Apostle\nJohn the Elder warned them of this careless negligence and admonished them to\nrevisit their first commitment to communal fellowship and love, otherwise, the light\nof the gospel will be taken away from them.\n",
      "STUDYGUIDES": "1. From Ephesians 1:15-20 and Rev 2:1-3, 6 analyse the zeal and love of the\nEphesian Christians.\n2. From your experience, how can you narrate the first love when a believer receives\nthe message of salvation? Narrate in the context of Acts 2:37,44-47.\n3. Critically analyse the actions of Peter in Matt 4:18-20 and in John 21: 3, 15 to\ndiscuss the instances of believers losing their first love. How are Christians losing\ntheir love for Christ in our generation and what are the consequences? Matt 10:33\nGal 2:11-16.\n4. What is the Biblical injunction for Christians if they would maintain their first\nlove for the gospel? 2Tim 2:22-26: Tit 3:2.\n",
      "CONCLUSION": "No matter how zealous we might be for the work of God, we must\nbe very careful so as not to easily shift our focus from the love for the gospel o of\nsalvation to carnality that may easily lead to strife. envy, and eventual backsliding\nfrom the race we started in Christ.\n",
      "FOODFORTHOUGHTS": "No matter the\n zeal, it cannot replace the love of Christ in\nChristendom.\n",
      "MEMORYVERSE": "Rev 2:4*Nevertheless I have somewhat againstt thee, because\nthou hast left thy first love'\".\n"
